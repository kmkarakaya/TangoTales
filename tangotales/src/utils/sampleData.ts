    title: "Por Una Cabeza",
    explanation: "Por Una Cabeza is one of the most recognizable tangos in popular culture, composed by Carlos Gardel with lyrics by Alfredo Le Pera in 1935. The title translates to 'By a Head' and uses horse racing as a metaphor for gambling and romance. The song has gained international fame through its use in Hollywood films, particularly in 'Scent of a Woman' and 'True Lies'. Gardel's passionate performance style and the song's dramatic crescendos make it a favorite among dancers and listeners alike. The piece perfectly embodies the Argentine concept of 'arrabal' - the outskirts of Buenos Aires where tango was born.",

    title: "El Choclo",
    explanation: "El Choclo, composed by √Ångel Villoldo in 1903, is one of the earliest and most influential tangos ever written. The title refers to corn on the cob, a humble food that became a metaphor for the simple pleasures of Buenos Aires street life. Villoldo, often called the 'Father of Tango', created this piece during tango's formative years when it was still considered music of the lower classes. The song's playful melody and rhythmic complexity helped establish many of the musical conventions that would define tango for generations. El Choclo represents the transition from tango's folk roots to its more sophisticated orchestral arrangements.",

    title: "Adi√≥s Nonino",
    explanation: "Adi√≥s Nonino is a masterpiece by Astor Piazzolla, composed in 1959 as a tribute to his father who had just passed away. 'Nonino' was Piazzolla's childhood nickname for his father. This deeply personal composition marked a turning point in Piazzolla's career, showcasing his revolutionary 'nuevo tango' style that incorporated elements of jazz and classical music. The piece is known for its emotional intensity and complex harmonies, breaking away from traditional tango conventions while maintaining its emotional core.

    title: "Libertango",
    explanation: "Libertango, composed by Astor Piazzolla in 1974, represents the ultimate expression of 'nuevo tango' - a revolutionary fusion of traditional tango with jazz and classical elements. The title combines 'liberty' and 'tango', symbolizing Piazzolla's liberation from traditional tango constraints. Written during his time in Italy, the piece features complex rhythms, dissonant harmonies, and extended techniques that shocked traditional tango purists but attracted a new international audience. Libertango has been adapted for various instruments and ensembles, becoming one of the most recognizable pieces of contemporary Argentine music and helping to bring tango to concert halls worldwide.",
