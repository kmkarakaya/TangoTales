# Background Image Setup

To complete the tango-themed background, please add the tango painting image:

1. Download the image from: https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/71762f76-ef24-4bc9-a7c1-f2b6ddb0131b
2. Save it as `tango-background.jpg` in this directory (`public/images/`)
3. The image will automatically be displayed as the homepage background

The CSS is already configured to use this image with proper overlays for text readability.

## Alternative: Use a Different Image

If you want to use a different tango painting:
1. Save your image as `tango-background.jpg` in this directory
2. Recommended dimensions: at least 1920x1080 pixels
3. The image will be displayed with a dark overlay to ensure text readability
