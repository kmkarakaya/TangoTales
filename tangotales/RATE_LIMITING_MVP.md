# Rate Limiting MVP - Manual Testing Guide

## Implementation Summary

‚úÖ **COMPLETED**: Client-side rate limiting for AI requests

### Files Modified:
1. `src/utils/config.ts` - Added rate limiting constants
2. `src/services/enhancedGeminiWithProgress.ts` - Added concurrency control and delay enforcement

### Rate Limiting Rules Implemented:
- **Max Concurrent Requests**: 1 (only one AI research can run at a time)
- **Minimum Delay**: 2000ms (2 seconds between AI requests)
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages when limits are hit

## Manual Testing Instructions

### Test 1: Concurrent Request Prevention
1. Open the app: http://localhost:3001
2. Navigate to the Enhanced Search page
3. Start an AI research for a song (e.g., "La Cumparsita")
4. While the first research is running, try to start another AI research
5. **Expected Result**: Second request should show error: "Another AI request is in progress. Please wait for it to complete before starting a new research."

### Test 2: Delay Between Requests  
1. Complete an AI research request
2. Immediately try to start another AI research
3. **Expected Result**: There should be a 2-second delay before the second request starts (you'll see the delay in console logs: "‚è≥ RATE LIMIT - Enforcing delay: XXXXms")

### Test 3: Normal Operation
1. Wait for any active requests to complete
2. Wait at least 2 seconds after the last request
3. Start a new AI research
4. **Expected Result**: Request should proceed normally without delays or blocks

## Console Log Monitoring

Watch the browser console for these rate limiting debug messages:
- `üîÑ RATE LIMIT - Active requests: 1` - When request starts
- `‚è≥ RATE LIMIT - Enforcing delay: XXXms` - When delay is applied
- `‚ö†Ô∏è RATE LIMIT - Concurrent request blocked` - When concurrent request is rejected
- `üîÑ RATE LIMIT - Request completed. Active requests: 0` - When request finishes

## Success Criteria

‚úÖ User cannot start multiple AI research requests simultaneously  
‚úÖ Minimum 2-second delay enforced between requests  
‚úÖ Clear error messages displayed when limits are hit  
‚úÖ No breaking changes to existing functionality  
‚úÖ Build and development server work correctly

## Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)

The following features can be added later:
- Per-model rate limits
- Daily usage caps
- Queuing system instead of rejection
- Cross-tab coordination via localStorage
- Telemetry and analytics for rate limiting events
- UI indicators for rate limit status

## Technical Details

### Configuration
```typescript
// In src/utils/config.ts
rateLimits: {
  MAX_CONCURRENT_AI_REQUESTS: 1,
  MIN_REQUEST_DELAY_MS: 2000
}
```

### Implementation
- Static counters track active requests and last request time
- Concurrency check before AI client initialization  
- Delay enforcement using Promise-based setTimeout
- try/finally blocks ensure counters are always decremented
- Error messages provide clear user feedback

This MVP implementation provides **80% of the protection with 20% of the complexity** and can be extended iteratively based on usage patterns.
