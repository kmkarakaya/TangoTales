## Codebase review & test run (2025-10-05)

- **Date/Time**: 2025-10-05 17:30
- **Summary**: Performed a quick full repository review and attempted to run tests after a small test update. Noted a failing test run due to a missing/unresolved module import (`react-router-dom`) in `src/App.tsx` during Jest resolution.
- **Actions Taken**:

  - Scanned project files and `package.json` to verify dependencies and test scripts.
  - Ran `npm test` in `tangotales`; observed Jest failed resolving `react-router-dom` when importing `src/App.tsx`.
  - Created an initial status entry for the `App.test.tsx` change (existing entry retained below).

- **Files Modified**:

  - README.md (developer notes addition)
  - status.md (this entry)

- **Comparison to To-Do List**:

  - ✅ Repo scan completed
  - ✅ `status.md` updated
  - ❌ Tests not yet validated due to missing module (see notes)

- **Notes**:

  - The project's `package.json` lists `react-router-dom` v7.9.3 as a dependency, but Jest reported it as missing in the test environment — likely due to an incomplete install or environment mismatch. Running `npm ci` or `npm install` in `tangotales` should resolve the issue.
  - Next steps: either install missing dependency or add a Jest mock for `react-router-dom` in `src/setupTests.ts`. I can make that change and re-run tests if you want.

## App.test.tsx - Test updated to site title

- **Date/Time**: 2025-10-05 16:59
- **Summary**: Updated unit test to assert the presence of the "TangoTales" site title instead of the default CRA sample text.
- **Actions Taken**:

  - Updated test in `tangotales/src/App.test.tsx` to check for "TangoTales" text.
  - Added a short recent-change note to `README.md`.

- **Files Modified**:

  - tangotales/src/App.test.tsx
  - README.md

- **Comparison to To-Do List**:

  - ✅ Update tests to match branding
  - ❌ Other pending tasks not yet addressed

- **Notes**: No blockers. This status entry was created to document the small branding-focused test change.

## README update: reflect current codebase features

- **Date/Time**: 2025-10-05 18:05
- **Summary**: Updated `README.md` to include features discovered in the codebase that were missing from docs: Enhanced search service/page/hook, AI research progress UI, and Analytics dashboard page.
- **Actions Taken**:

  - Added `EnhancedSearchPage` and `EnhancedSearchService` bullets into the Features section.
  - Documented `AIResearchProgress` streaming/progress behavior and `enhancedGeminiWithProgress` usage.
  - Listed `AnalyticsDashboardPage` in the Project Structure and Advanced Component System.
  - Kept README style and organization consistent with existing sections.

- **Files Modified**:

  - README.md
  - status.md

- **Comparison to To-Do List**:

  - ✅ README updated to reflect current codebase
  - ✅ status.md updated with new entry

- **Notes**: No functional code changes. Tests still require dependency resolution in `tangotales` before full test validation.
