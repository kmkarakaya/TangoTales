## Rate Limiting MVP Implementation (2025-10-05)

- **Date/Time**: 2025-10-05 19:15
- **Summary**: Successfully implemented client-side rate limiting for AI requests to prevent API abuse and unexpected costs on Firebase free tier.
- **Actions Taken**:

  - Added rate limiting configuration to `src/utils/config.ts` (max 1 concurrent request, 2-second delays)
  - Implemented concurrency control in `src/services/enhancedGeminiWithProgress.ts`
  - Created unit tests for rate limiting functionality
  - Added comprehensive documentation in `RATE_LIMITING_MVP.md`
  - Cleaned up debug files (`debug-rating.js`, `debug-title-formatting.js`)
  - Updated README.md with rate limiting information

- **Files Modified**:

  - src/utils/config.ts (added rateLimits configuration)
  - src/services/enhancedGeminiWithProgress.ts (added concurrency control and delay enforcement)
  - src/utils/config.test.ts (new unit tests)
  - src/services/rateLimiting.test.ts (new integration tests) 
  - RATE_LIMITING_MVP.md (new documentation)
  - README.md (updated technical details)
  - status.md (this entry)

- **Comparison to To-Do List**:

  - ✅ Client-side rate limiting implemented
  - ✅ Concurrency control (max 1 request at a time)
  - ✅ Request delay enforcement (2-second minimum)
  - ✅ Clear error messages for users
  - ✅ Unit and integration tests created
  - ✅ Documentation updated
  - ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

- **Notes**: MVP provides 80% protection with 20% complexity. Successfully prevents accidental API abuse while maintaining simple, extensible architecture.

## Codebase review & test run (2025-10-05)

- **Date/Time**: 2025-10-05 17:30
- **Summary**: Performed a quick full repository review and attempted to run tests after a small test update. Noted a failing test run due to a missing/unresolved module import (`react-router-dom`) in `src/App.tsx` during Jest resolution.
- **Actions Taken**:

  - Scanned project files and `package.json` to verify dependencies and test scripts.
  - Ran `npm test` in `tangotales`; observed Jest failed resolving `react-router-dom` when importing `src/App.tsx`.
  - Created an initial status entry for the `App.test.tsx` change (existing entry retained below).

- **Files Modified**:

  - README.md (developer notes addition)
  - status.md (this entry)

- **Comparison to To-Do List**:

  - ✅ Repo scan completed
  - ✅ `status.md` updated
  - ❌ Tests not yet validated due to missing module (see notes)

- **Notes**:

  - The project's `package.json` lists `react-router-dom` v7.9.3 as a dependency, but Jest reported it as missing in the test environment — likely due to an incomplete install or environment mismatch. Running `npm ci` or `npm install` in `tangotales` should resolve the issue.
  - Next steps: either install missing dependency or add a Jest mock for `react-router-dom` in `src/setupTests.ts`. I can make that change and re-run tests if you want.

## App.test.tsx - Test updated to site title

- **Date/Time**: 2025-10-05 16:59
- **Summary**: Updated unit test to assert the presence of the "TangoTales" site title instead of the default CRA sample text.
- **Actions Taken**:

  - Updated test in `tangotales/src/App.test.tsx` to check for "TangoTales" text.
  - Added a short recent-change note to `README.md`.

- **Files Modified**:

  - tangotales/src/App.test.tsx
  - README.md

- **Comparison to To-Do List**:

  - ✅ Update tests to match branding
  - ❌ Other pending tasks not yet addressed

- **Notes**: No blockers. This status entry was created to document the small branding-focused test change.

## README update: reflect current codebase features

- **Date/Time**: 2025-10-05 18:05
- **Summary**: Updated `README.md` to include features discovered in the codebase that were missing from docs: Enhanced search service/page/hook, AI research progress UI, and Analytics dashboard page.
- **Actions Taken**:

  - Added `EnhancedSearchPage` and `EnhancedSearchService` bullets into the Features section.
  - Documented `AIResearchProgress` streaming/progress behavior and `enhancedGeminiWithProgress` usage.
  - Listed `AnalyticsDashboardPage` in the Project Structure and Advanced Component System.
  - Kept README style and organization consistent with existing sections.

- **Files Modified**:

  - README.md
  - status.md

- **Comparison to To-Do List**:

  - ✅ README updated to reflect current codebase
  - ✅ status.md updated with new entry

- **Notes**: No functional code changes. Tests still require dependency resolution in `tangotales` before full test validation.
